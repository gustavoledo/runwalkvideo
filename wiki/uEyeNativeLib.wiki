Some thoughts on extending the ueye-nativelib shared library for integrating uEye camera'z

= Some proposals to improve ueye-nativelib =

 * Try to use Direct3D from the native code
 * Create a full screen window from JAVA code
 
= Details =

 * Retrieve the GraphicsDevice instance for a current monitor
 * Create a new Frame and set it using setFullScreenWindow()
 * Add a Canvas to the Frame in fullscreen mode
 * Get the native handle (HWND) for that Canvas using the Native JNA class
 * Add a parameter to startRunning() accepting a HWND handle
 * At native side, check if parameter is present
 * If present, try to render in Direct3D (thread creation not needed?)
 * If not present, proceed with code as it is now (creating a new window)
